# Calculate It

Having previously built [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org) apps with the **Options API**, I decided to challenge myself and gain hands-on experience with the **Composition API**.

## Overview 🔎

### About the challenge 🤷

The challenge aims to test the developer's skill in:

- state management using `reactive` and `ref` functions
- managing lifecycle hooks with `onMounted`, `onBeforeMount` etc
- handling side effects using `watch`
- creating and managing global state with `provide` and `inject`
- managing transitions the Vue way with the `transition` and `transition-group` components

### Quickstart guide 📜

To run the code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. You might need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the following steps.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the repository.
4. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install required dependencies (This will create a **node_modules** folder.)
5. Run `npm run dev` to spin up the development server. You can view the app at **localhost:5173**
   (or whichever port is shown in your terminal).

## My process ⚙

After getting the hang of the **Composition API**, I searched for project ideas to get hands on practice. I decided that building a calculator app would be a great exercise. The design and functionality were largely inspired by this [Calculator by Xiaomi Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miui.calculator)

With the idea in mind, I began the design process, creating wireframes and detailing colors, layouts, and typography. After the intial design phase, I arrived at a satisfactory design.

Having captured most of my ideas, I initialized the Vue app and began implementing the design meeting the requirements one line of code at a time. 🏁

### Built with 🛠✏📐

- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

<br/>

### What I learned 🎓

I built this calculator app after learning the **Composition API** in [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org). Unlike the **Options API** which organized code by options like `data`, `methods`, and `computed`, the **Composition API** allows for more flexible and modular code organization. By using hooks and reusable functions, the **Composition API** makes it easier to manage complex logic and share functionality across components. I believe this app demonstrates these advantages, offering a clean and efficient approach to building **Vue** applicationss.

<br/>

**What I'm proud of** 😎

Building any application from start to finish is always fulfilling, but here's a notable achievement.

Interestingly, it's not directly related to the calculator app itself. After struggling with deployment, I stepped back and created a separate app - a guide for [Vue 3 Vite GitHub Deployment](https://allankirui.github.io/vue-3-vite-github-deployment). This guide not only helped me successfully deploy the caclulator app but will also be invaluable for my future Vue Vite projects.

<br/>

### Continued development ⏱

As I release this application, I am currently learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com). Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing my frontend skills while also diving into backend development. I look forward to harnessing the power of **Laravel** and **Vue** to create amazing applications.
